# Medical Charges Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses **Linear Regression** to predict **medical insurance charges** based on patient attributes such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region. The dataset is sourced from an insurance dataset and cleaned to remove any inconsistencies. The model is evaluated using RMSE to measure prediction accuracy.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handle missing values and categorical encoding.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize correlations between medical charges and other attributes.
- **Model Training**: Train a **Linear Regression** model using `sklearn`.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Measure RMSE to check model accuracy.
- **Deployment Ready**: Can be integrated into an API or a web application.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset consists of the following columns:
- `age`: Age of the individual
- `sex`: Gender of the individual (male/female)
- `bmi`: Body Mass Index
- `children`: Number of dependents
- `smoker`: Whether the individual is a smoker or not
- `region`: Geographical region
- `charges`: Medical insurance cost (target variable)



## 📈 Model Performance
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** ~6000 (indicating moderate accuracy)
- **Feature Importance:** Smoking and BMI were found to be the most significant predictors.

## 🌍 Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.
- Deploy the model as a FastAPI service.
- Experiment with polynomial regression for better results.
