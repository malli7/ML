# 🌦️ Weather Prediction Using Decision Trees & Random Forest

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how to use Decision Trees and Random Forest models to predict rainfall using a Kaggle weather dataset. The workflow includes:
- Data exploration & preprocessing
- Feature selection & engineering
- Model training and evaluation

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains historical weather data across multiple Australian locations. The target variable is `RainTomorrow`, indicating whether it will rain the next day.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning

## 🚀 Project Workflow
### 1️⃣ Data Loading & Exploration
- Load the dataset from Kaggle.
- Inspect missing values and drop unnecessary columns.

### 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values.
- Convert categorical variables into numerical format.

### 3️⃣ Model Training & Evaluation
- Train a **Decision Tree Classifier**.
- Train a **Random Forest Classifier**.
- Evaluate models using accuracy and confusion matrices.

## 📊 Results & Insights
- **Decision Trees** provide interpretability but are prone to overfitting.
- **Random Forests** offer better accuracy and generalization due to ensembling.
- Feature selection significantly improves model performance.


## 📌 Future Improvements
- Implement hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy.
- Experiment with other ML models (e.g., XGBoost, Neural Networks).
